Feature: Web Interface
  As an Internet-literate super villian
  I want to interact with my bomb using a Web browser
  Because it works well for my coffee machine

Scenario: Navigate to bomb web interface
  Given my bomb is started
  When I navigate to the bomb control interface in my browser
  I see the bomb controls
