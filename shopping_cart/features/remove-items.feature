Feature: Remove items from cart
  As a shopper
  I want to remove items from my cart
  Because I had second thoughts about purchasing them

  Happy:
    Remove item from cart and item no longer shows in cart
  Sad:
    Remove item which is not present in cart (e.g. from stale page)
  Bad:
    Remove improperly identified item (invalid/missing SKU)
