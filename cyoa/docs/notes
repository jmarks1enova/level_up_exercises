What to do in a nightlife event catalog:

Requirements:
(1) Scheduled caching of data sources to drive application
(2) Multiple data sources
(3) iCal distribution
(4) User selects data sources, so can incl/excl events based on what data source
provided them
(5) "Customized calendar link" - What is this?
(6) iCal calendar can be added to Google cal and future events show up therea
(7) User logs in to maintain preferences (perhaps configure named calendars to
publish with criteria-based content)

Enhancements:

- Also do vCal?


Critical concepts
- Event
- data source
- keyword
- tags
- data source abstration layer to normalize events

Approach:
- Read about i/vcal to understand scheduling fields
- Inspect various API capabilities for data acquisition
- Determine event publication API structure

- Give user a feed builder
  - Each feed has a name
  - Each feed has a configuration
  - Each feed has a publication URL
  - Each feed has a query interface?

- Data sources
  - A name
  - A URL to visit
  - A brief description of what content it provides

- On-the-fly feed resource constructed by URL-based nomenclature

Event index:
- Full text indexing?
- Keyword indexing?
- User tag indexing?
