Feature: Alert e-mail when subscribed feed acquires new event
  As a subscriber to a feed
  I want to receive e-mail alerts when new events appear in the feed
  So I am quickly aware of new opportunities

Scenario: Create new feed subscription

Scenario: New event on subscribed feed produces e-mail alert

Scenario: Repeated subscription for same feed has no effect

Scenario: One alert per new event per user even from multiple subscribed feeds
